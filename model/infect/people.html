		<h2>People</h2>
		<p>
			In this model, there are two separate issues for people with covid.  How infectious they are and how sick they are.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Most people are not infectious at all, some are somewhat infectious, some are very infectious, and some are exceedingly infectious.  Within these categories infectiousness waxes and wanes over time.  They start with an incubation period where they are not infectious, ramp up to a period of peak infectiousness and then decline to no longer being infectious.  Note: people who are no longer infectious still show symptoms (which may be severe).
		</p>
		<p>
			Everyone infected shows symptoms.  This coincides with the onset of peak infectiousness.  People may be just symptomatic, sick enough to have to stay home, need to go to the hospital, require intensive care, or dead.  A random selection of people at any level will move on to the next level.  We are not modeling long covid, anyone who does not die recovers.
		</p>
		<p>
			People are represented on the display by the symbols illustrated below.  The meaning of the symbols changes depending on whether you are doing exposition or playing the game.
