		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<div class="para">
			In this game, the user is responsible for public health measures to protect a village with a thousand residents, served by businesses, housing, churches, and recreational facilities. The decisions the user makes can check the pread of the covid-19 virus within the village. Unfortunately, these desisions also economic, social and cultural effects which make some of them unpopular.
			The point of the game is to reduce the spread of covid;the secondry object is to impose as few disrupotions on the life of the community as possible. 
			The model shows individual people going about their lives: to work, home, to entertainment venues and to worship services. It shows the ones who stay healthy, the ones who get sick, the ones who go to hospital, and the ones who die. 
			</div>
		<div class="para">
			The model assumes all people infected are potentially infectious, but some people are more infectious than others, and all infected people are infectious only at certain points in the progression of their illness. When determining who does or does not get infected, the model takes distance, ventilation, and volume of breath into account.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			As a game player, you take charge of the public health response to the disease. You control all the measures designed to control the spread of the virus. You can shut down bars, clubs and workplaces, institute quarantines and contact tracing, mandate isolation for infected people, and require mask wearing. You have the power, but to keep it, you must succeed in protecting people.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			You start with a fixed amount of political capital.  All the available actions will cost you capital, as closures result in economic losses and mandates provoke public resistance. On the other hand, if you do nothing the rapidly spreading disease will leave most people sick at home, send enough people to the hospital to overflow the wards and the intensive care unit, and send an unlucky few to the graveyard. Funerals and jammed hospitals, with patients cared for on gurneys in the halls: these will also cost you capital. If your capital drops to zero, you lose the game.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			 The game runs for a maximum of 400 days. If you make it through the 400 days with capital left, you win. The goal is to win; the ideal is to win with as much capital as possible.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The game starts with an illustration of what happens if you do not intervene in the infection.  It runs for an indefinite period.
