		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<div class="para">
			In this game, the user is responsible for public health measures to protect a village with a thousand residents, served by businesses, 
			industries, houses of worship, and recreational facilities. Resident of this town live in both private residences both large and small, 
			and in congregate settings such as bunkhouses. As a game player, you take charge of the public health response to the disease. You control 
			the measures designed to control the spread of the virus; these include closing bars, clubs and workplaces, quaranting and contact tracing
			the sick, and requiring mask wearing. The choices you make can check the spread of the covid-19 virus within the village. Unfortunately, 
			these decisions also have economic, social and cultural effects which make some of them unpopular.
			The point of the game is to reduce the spread of covid, save lives, and prevent illness. The secondary object is to impose as few disruptions 
			on the life of the community as possible.
			</div>
		<div class="para">
			The game design assumes all people infected are potentially infectious, but some people are more infectious than others, and all infected 
			people are infectious only at certain points in the progression of their illness. When determining who does or does not get infected, the 
			game takes distance, ventilation, and volume of breath into account. If you look carefully at the spaces representing the various bars, 
			clubs, offices and industrial workplaces, you will see they have lines at their edges, indicating the level of noise (noisy spaces cause 
			people to speak more loudly, facilitating the spread of Covid), and ventilation. You can determine crowding by observing the number of 
			people in the space. All these factors will affect your decisions about which facilities to restrict, and which facilities to leave open. 
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The game is scored based on political capital. You start with a fixed amount of political capital.  All the actions you can take, from closing 
			entertainment venues to requiring masks, will cost you capital: closures result in economic losses and mandates provoke public resistance. On 
			the other hand, if you do nothing the rapidly spreading disease will leave most people sick at home, send enough people to the hospital to 
			overflow the wards and the intensive care unit, and send an unlucky few to the graveyard. Funerals and jammed hospitals, with patients cared 
			for on gurneys in the halls: these will also cost you capital. If your capital drops to zero, you lose the game.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The game runs for a maximum of 100 days. If you make it through the 100 days with capital left, you win. The goal is to win; the ideal is 
			to win with as much capital as possible.
	   </div>
	   <div class="para">
			Before you start the game, you can choose the difficulty level; you can allow yourself to see who gets infected the moment they
			catch the virus, or you can play with a more realistic simulation in which you don't know who has the virus unless they test positive
			 or get sick. You can start with a large amount of political capital, or a small amount. 
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The game display gives you three sources of information: you can view a display of the villagers going about their lives, from their homes to 
			work, to worship, and to clubs and bars. You can follow the infections and the progress of the illness, see as the villagers go into isolation,
			into hospital, into intensive care, and for an unlucky few, into the grave. For an overview of the process, the display includes a table giving 
			numbers of sick people and other information about your status. For an overview, the game display also includes line graphs giving the measures 
			of your progress, including the current score and the trend the score is following.
		</div>
		<div class="para">
			The game starts with an illustration of what happens if you do not intervene in the infection.  You will see people going about their lives: 
			to work, home, to entertainment venues and to worship services. You will see those who stay healthy, the ones who get sick, the ones who 
			go to hospital, and the ones who die. This introduction runs until you start the game.
