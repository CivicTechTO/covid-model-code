		<h2>Rooms</h2>
						
			<p>			
				Rooms are where infections occur. Room environments affect infection rates.  The blue bars on the left show ventilation (higher is worse), red bars on the right show breathing volume.  
			</p>
						
			<p>
				People move into rooms depending on the time of day (and day of week).
				People's motion inside rooms depend on the type of room and (for some rooms) on the time.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Weekday</li>
					<div>
						People leave their homes for for weekday places at 8:00 in the morning. Some people stay home. Everybody does the same thing every weekday. All weekday places are primarily static grids, people are randomly selected to move to a different place in the room and return to their normal location.
					</div>
					<div>
						The rooms are differentiated to allow a player to chose which set of rooms to close.
					</div>
					<ul>
						<li>Schools<div class="swatch school-colour"></div></li>
						<li>Offices<div class="swatch office-colour"></div></li>
						<li>Meat packing<div class="swatch meat-colour"></div></li>
					</ul>
				<li>Dwellings</li>

					<div>
						Dwellings are where people sleep at night.  Every person is assigned a dwelling.
					</div>
								
					<ul>
						<li>Houses<div class="swatch house-colour"></div></li>
							<div>
								Some people in houses stay home during weekdays.  There are also occasional house parties.
							</div>

						<li>Bunkhouses<div class="swatch bunkhouse-colour"></div></li>
							<div>
								Bunkhouses have more residents, which increases infection risk.
							</div>
					</ul>
					
					<li>Houses of worship<div class="swatch church-colour"></div></li>
						<div>
							These are open on Sunday mornings.  
							Every person is assigned a location for that time, which is either worshipping, at home, or at a park.
							When worshipping people switch between random motion and grid and back again.
						</div>
				<li>Other</li>
					<div>
						These are the places people go on evenings and weekends.
						Randomly selected people move between these places (or go home).
					</div>
						
					<ul>
						<li>Restaurants<div class="swatch restaurant-colour"></div></li>
							<div>
								These are open during weekend afternoons and every evening.
								People are grouped in tables of four.
								People are randomly assigned to a restaurant when they are open.  
								New arrivals are seated at the first table with an empty seat.
								If there is no seat for a new arrival they are sent to another restaurant.
								Tables depart together.
							</div>
						<li>Bars<div class="swatch bar-colour"></div></li>
							<div>
								These are open during weekend afternoons and every evening.
								People are randomly assigned to a bar when they are open.  
								People are seated in the first available seat.  
								If there is no seat for a new arrival they are sent to another bar.
							</div>
						<li>Clubs<div class="swatch club-colour"></div></li>
							<div>
								These are open during later evenings.
								Randomly selected people go to them.
								People in them move around quickly and randomly.
							</div>
					</ul>
				<li>Parks<div class="swatch outside-colour"></div></li>
					<div>
						It is possible to get infected in parks, but the ventilation is very good.
						Some people are assigned to a park for Sunday mornings.
						Otherwise, people are randomly assigned to a park on evenings and weekends.

					</div>
				<li>Cemetary<div class="swatch cemetary-colour"></div></li>
				<li>Hospital</li>
					<div>
						There is no infection transmission in the hospital.
						When a person gets sick enough, they are sent to the hospital, to the ward if there is space, otherwise to the hallway.  
						If they get sicker they are transfered to the ICU (if available, there is only room for one person).  As they recover they get transfered back to the ward or, if completely recovered, sent home.  If they die they are sent to the cemetary.
					</div>
