    <p>
      Houses and bunkhouses are collectively known as dwellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      People are allocated to dwellings.  They go there every night (if not isolating or in hospital).
      They also go there if they are too sick to work.  
      Some people are allocated to their house during the workday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people randomly visit other dwellings on evenings and weekends.  
      This can be preventing by closing house parties.
