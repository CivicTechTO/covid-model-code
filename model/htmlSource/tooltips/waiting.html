    <p>
      Waiting rooms are where people go if they should be in a ward or in the intensive care unit but there is no space.

      This model assumes that protective equipment in hospitals is effective, there is no transmission in hospitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having people in the waiting room is very costly politically.
