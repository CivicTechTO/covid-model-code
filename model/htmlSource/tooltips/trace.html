      The trace issue may be the most significant part of this game.  
      The assumption in the underlying model is that most people infected with Covid are not infectious at all, 
      while a small minority is incredibly infectious.  
      Whether this is actually true or not is expected to make a large difference in the effectiveness of tracing choices.

      Tracing means to look at travel patterns of an infected person and test people they have been in contact with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forward tracing means to try to find people that this case has infected by looking at recent travel patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Backward tracing means to try to find the person that infected this person by looking at less recent travel patterns,
      and then forward trace from the people found to be infected there.

    <p>
      Tracing is only available if testing is active.
