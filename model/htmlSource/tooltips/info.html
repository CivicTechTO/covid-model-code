    <h3>Time and Score Information</h3>
    <p>
      Time includes day number, day of week, and time of day.  Peoples behaviour depends on day of week and time of day.  
      The game lasts a limited number of days.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the game, you start with a fixed amount of political capital.  Disease progression will cost capital, as will interventions.  The object is to spend the least amount of capital possible to get to the game day limit.  If the available capital drops to zero the game stops and you lose.
