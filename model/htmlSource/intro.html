<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="para">
	In this game, the user is responsible for public health measures to protect a village with a thousand residents, served by businesses, 
	industries, houses of worship, and recreational facilities. Residents of this town live in both private residences both large and small, 
	and in congregate settings such as bunkhouses. As a game player, you take charge of the public health response to the disease. You control 
	the measures designed to control the spread of the virus; these include closing bars, clubs and workplaces, quaranting and contact tracing
	the sick, and requiring mask wearing. The choices you make can check the spread of the covid-19 virus within the village. Unfortunately, 
	these decisions also have economic, social and cultural effects which make some of them unpopular. The point of the game is to reduce the 
	spread of covid, save lives, and prevent illness. The secondary object is to impose as few disruptions on the life of the community as 
	possible.
