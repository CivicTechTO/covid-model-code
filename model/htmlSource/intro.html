<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="para">
	In this game, the user is responsible for public health measures to protect a village with a thousand residents, served by businesses, 
	industries, houses of worship, and recreational facilities. As a game player, you take charge of the public health response to the disease. You control 
	the measures designed to control the spread of the virus: closing bars, clubs and workplaces, quarantining and contact tracing, and requiring mask wearing. 
	The choices you make can check the spread of the covid-19 virus within the village. Unfortunately, 
	some of these decisions will be unpopular. The point of the game is to reduce the spread of covid, save lives, and prevent 
	illness. The secondary object is to impose as few disruptions on the life of the community as possible.
