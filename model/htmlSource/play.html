	All people infected are potentially infectious, but some people are more infectious than others, and all infected 
	people are infectious only at certain points in the progression of their illness. When determining who does or does not get infected, the 
	game takes distance, ventilation, and volume of breath into account. If you look carefully at the spaces representing the various bars, 
	clubs, offices and industrial workplaces, you will see they have lines at their edges, indicating the level of noise (noisy spaces cause 
	people to speak more loudly, facilitating the spread of Covid), and ventilation. You can determine crowding by observing the number of 
	people in the space. All these factors will affect your decisions about which facilities to restrict, and which facilities to leave open.

<h2>How to win</h2>
<div class="para">
	The game is scored based on political capital. You start with a fixed amount of political capital.  All the actions you can take, from closing 
	entertainment venues to requiring masks, will cost you capital: closures result in economic losses and mandates provoke public resistance. On 
	the other hand, if you do nothing the rapidly spreading disease will leave most people sick at home, send enough people to the hospital to 
	overflow the wards and the intensive care unit, and send an unlucky few to the graveyard. Funerals and jammed hospitals, with patients cared 
	for on gurneys in the halls: these will also cost you capital. If your capital drops to zero, you lose the game.
</div>
<div class="para">
	The game runs for a maximum of 100 days. If you make it through the 100 days with capital left, you win. The goal is to win; the ideal is 
	to win with as much capital as possible.

<h2>Before you begin</h2>
<div class="para">
	Before you start the game, you can choose the difficulty level: you can start off with nobody infected, or with a seriously infected 
	person about to enter a house of worship; you can allow yourself to see who gets infected the moment they catch the virus, or you can 
	play with a more realistic simulation in which you don't know who has the virus unless they test positive or get sick. You can start 
	with a large amount of political capital, or a small amount. 
</div>
<h2>What you will see</h2>
<div class="para">
	The game display gives you three sources of information: you can view a display of the villagers (pictured below) going about their lives, from 
	their homes to work, to worship, and to clubs and bars. If you click on the village display, a tip will appear, describing the purpose of the space 
	(office, home, school, etc.) you clicked on. You can follow the infections and the progress of the illness, see the villagers go into isolation,
	into hospital, into intensive care, and for an unlucky few, into the grave. For an overview of the process, the display includes a table giving 
	numbers of sick people and other information about your status. For an overview, the game display also includes line graphs giving the measures 
	of your progress, including the current score and the trend the score is following.

<div class="para">
	The game starts with an illustration of what happens if you do not intervene in the infection.  You will see people going about their lives: 
	to work, home, to entertainment venues and to worship services. You will see those who stay healthy, the ones who get sick, the ones who 
	go to hospital, and the ones who die. This introduction runs until you start the game.
