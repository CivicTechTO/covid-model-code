Hi Mila

I blundered horribly, I closed the breakout room before I copied your email.

I am pushing this to the github repo in the hopes that it will send you a notification.

I truly hope to hear from you.

Also I forgot to tell you about the slack channel.  I searched for you on slack, I sent a message to someone I hope was you.

Jim
