		<h3>Transmission</h3>
		<p>
			During each time step in the model for each room two sets get created. The set of infectable people and the set of infectious people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each infectable person has a viral load from previous steps (may be zero).
			The step starts by decaying their viral load.  
			For every infectable person all the infectious people add to their viral load.  
			Mow much depends on how infectious the person is, how far apart they are, and the ventilation and loudness of the room.
			Masks also affect the viral load increase.
		</p>

		<p>
			The viral load is then divided by a scale factor so that is between zero and one.
			This number is then raised to an arbitrary power (possibly less than one) to produce an infection probability.
			If the person is infected, they then have seven chances out of ten to be not infectious, one chance to be sligtly infectious, one chance to be very infectious, and one chance to be exceedingly infectious.
